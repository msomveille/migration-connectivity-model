# migration-connectivity-model

Here is provided the code for running a migratory connectivity model that includes: (1) intra-specific competition for access to resources, (2) the cost of migratory movement and (3) conformity.

This project intends to investigate the emergence of migratory divides in simple synthetic populations as well as real world migratory species. The case of the migration of the white storks (Ciconia ciconia) is explored using the model.

The model is written in Julia, and the preparation of white storks data as well as plotting the results are written in R.
